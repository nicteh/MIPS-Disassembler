# MIPS Disassembler in Python
MIPS Disassembler in Python
- Created as a project for CS 472 Computer Architecture at Boston University

Details:
- A partial disassembler for MIPS instructions
- Input will be the 32-bit machine instructions that a compiler or assembler produces.
- The program will then figure out what the original source course instructions were that created those 32-bit machine instructions and outputs them.
- The possible source instructions that can be disassembled are: add, sub, and, or, slt, lw, sw, beq, bne.
